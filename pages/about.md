I was drawn to the field of data science by the ability to use tools such as machine learning, AWS, and Python, as a tool to improve companies efficency, profitability, and agility. My attention is constantly being held by what might lie within the data. I enjoy looking for patterns and relationships that lie in the data I am exploring. It is what gets me up in the morning!

I am particularly fascinated by neural networks and deep learning, but I am also well versed in other tools that could perform just as well or better, such as random forests and gradient boosting. I like to wrestle with financial data in my spare time to keep me sharp between my ears.

If I am not at home you will most likely find me somewhere in the mountains cruising the powder at Winter Park or riding my dirt bike in the mountains around Lyons. I am a lover of craft beer as well as craft burgers. I am a Colorado native and local if you have any questions please feel free to reach out or connect with me on linkedin.
